- This repository contains my personal projects, the main one being my 3rd year CompSci project at the University of Liverpool, where I built a visitor app for the Ness Botanic Gardens in the Wirral. This app was written in Swift for iOS.
- I'm hoping this repo will be slowly built up with other projects over the coming years.
