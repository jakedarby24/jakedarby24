- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jakedarby24. I'm currently working as a Software Developer at Wadaro in the UK. My work involves working with Javascript, React and MongoDB, all of which I now have a solid amount of experience in.

- This repository contains my personal projects, the main one being my 3rd year CompSci project at the University of Liverpool, where I built a visitor app for the Ness Botanic Gardens in the Wirral. This app was written in Swift for iOS.
- I'm hoping this repo will be slowly built up with other projects over the coming years.
